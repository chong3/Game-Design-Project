Objective: In this game you are playing as a samurai and your goal is to reach the top of the tower by defeating the ninja enemies and killing the boss.

How the game works: This entire game takes place inside one of those Pagodas and the view of the game is from the side. As you enter each level, the enemy ninjas that stand around the room begin to attack, and you must defeat them with your sword. When you do, a door opens that lets you into the next room. In each progressive room, more and more enemies spawn. They start off using only their hands to attack, but later begin to spawn with swords. When you die, you respawn in the now empty room below the one you died in. These rooms should also have various platforms throughout each room, and each room should be different. While the inside of the room should take up most of the screen, You should be able to see a little bit of the outside walls of the pagoda with mountainous terrain in the background.

Gameplay Mechanics: The main character moves using “wasd” controls, and attacks using “n”. He can sprint by double tapping either “w” or “d”.  He can also attack with his sword whilst in the air. His normal attacks do 1 damage, and it takes 3 hits to kill a normal ninja. He has a special move which can be activated by pressing “m”, in which the character does a swirl while attacking all sides. This attack can one shot the ninjas. However, it has a cooldown so you have to use it very sparingly. The Boss – At the very top level, you have to fight just one ninja, who has a much larger health bar. Occasionally he can also teleport behind you to attack.
Multiplayer: You can play through these 10 levels with another player, changing the controls of player one to “wasd” and 1 and 2 replacing n and m. The second player uses the arrow keys and n and m.

Experimental Feature: Allow the player to switch to a separate game mode where they can play in one on one’s again the second player. they fight against each other
